## Documentation


The problem statement is depends on **prediction algorithm**.

• The Given dataset contains information about used car globally.

• The Dataset contain 10 different variables in different data type.

• The Target variable in dataset is **“Miles Per Gallon”(MPG)**. 

• There are nine other variables to be analyzed with target variable. 

• Use only **machine learning algorithms** to make prediction model.

• Avoid **over-fitting** of the model. 

• Understand the relation in between the independent variable as well. 

• Try to convert everything as numbers before feeding to model.

• **Analyze the dataset** properly and check for missing values. 

• Use **Expolartory Data Analysis** Technique to understand and filter dataset. 

• Improve the **model accuracy** over 93%

You can find the DataSet for the Project in the repostiory.
